    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>When I was in school, I acceled in my education. I was getting through each class with easy merit and even excellences, but my friends needed some help when it came to some subjects. They usually asked me for help when they came across a difficult question, and they'd usually refer to me as the smart one of the group.
      So I thought to myself, "There are probably other people out there like my friends, but they don't have someone to help them.", leading me to make this website to help with their maths.
      I have another friend who I relied on sometimes in time of struggle, so he also made a website to help others, but his topic is mainly physics.
