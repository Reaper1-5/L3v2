    <h3>What even is calculus?</h3>
    <p>We use calculus to find a rate of change in a number or the area undeneath of a curve. But to start with calculus we need to understand the most basic of graphs, such as the parabolic, regression and cubic.</p><br>
    <p>We'll start with the easiest, the regression. This is also known as a linear line and follows the following formula: $$ y = mx + c $$ \(y\) being the y co-ordinate<br>\(m\) being the gradient or slope of the line<br>\(x\) being the x co-ordinate<br>\(c\) being the y-intercept of the line</p><br><br>
    <p>The form of this line is a straight line that is either positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing), and the slope of a line is controled with the gradient or \(m\)</p>
    <p>Now there is the parabolic curve, which is indicated when the equation contains a variable to the power of 2 (for e.g. \(x^2\)). A parabolic equation looks like this: $$ y = x^2 $$</p><br>
    <p>But because this is a curve, the slope of the curve changes and isn't a constant like a straight regression line. So to find the gradient equation we have to find what is called a 'derivative'</p><br>
    <h3>Derivatives</h3>
    <p>To find a derivative we use this simple formula: $$ \frac{dy}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} $$ This equation is saying "The derivative of \(x^2\) is \(nx\) to the power of \(n-1\)" (n being the power that is applied to the x, which in the case of a parabola is 2)</p><br>
    <p>With this, now we can find the gradient equation of a parabola like so: $$ \frac{dy}{dx} x^2 = 2x^{2-1} = 2x $$ Now we know that the gradient for a parabola at the point \(y\) is \(2x\) <p>
